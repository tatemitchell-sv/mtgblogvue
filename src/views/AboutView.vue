    <h2>About the Blog</h2>
    <p>This blog is designed to share some of my favorite cards that Wizards of the Coast has designed. It is primarily
        focused on the Commander format (including high powered CEDH play), and a few exceptions being for standard and
        the MTG Arena Historic Brawl format.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Tate. I started playing Magic the Gathering seriously at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak as a
        way to spend time with roommates, though I was introduced to it much earlier.</p>
